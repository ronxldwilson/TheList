    cardSubContent: `We're building InTacht (Intelligent Global Infrastructure), which is basically a modern Cloud Runtime that enables startups to efficiently create & manage their own AI infrastructure like GPU clusters and integrate modern AI chips or custom hardware like ASICs &  FPGAs. Offering greater compute flexibility while simplifying development. Devs can build applications as if for a single machine, and InTacht handles scaling & distribution across multiple servers. This approach streamlines infrastructure management, allowing teams to focus on core AI development rather than complex networking and infrastructure concerns.`,

      about_the_product: `"Compute is going to be the currency of the future.” as Sam Altman says. But compute is awfully expensive and energy-hungry (Big Tech are building/reviving nuclear reactors to power data centers).
      <br> <br>
      Recently Garry TanCustom ASICs(Application Specific IC) and FPGA-based modern AI chips can optimize calculations such as data compression, inference, or encryption tasks, theoretically 5x faster with 10x less energy compared to GPU, which is a breakthrough. 
      <br> <br>

      Our core hypothesis is that computation will shift from GPUs to custom ASICs-based modern AI chips. ( Rather it is happening as Google ditched NVIDIA GPUs a long time ago with TPU & AWS launched Trainium chips recently, as well as modern chips like Groq & Cerebras beating the Benchmarks). Therefore InTacht aims to facilitate the creation of custom clusters that combine ASICs, FPGAs, and modern AI chips, or offer them through a shared cloud.
